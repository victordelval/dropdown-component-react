## Short Description
The objective of the project is to create a dropdown component with React.

For the loading of data in the dropdown to work, you can use the [simple-nodejs-server](https://github.com/victordelval/simple-nodejs-server) project that starts an http server on port 9000, serving the list of countries required.
